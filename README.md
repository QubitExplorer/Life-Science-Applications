# Life-Science-Applications

Here, we will be exploring few healthcare life science applications, and to understand about basics of human gene, DNA, RNA and proteins, classifications, major diseases traits and role of AI in healthcare applications.

**Please note:** Healthcare requires a high level of expertise, and the information provided here is intended solely for educational purposes only. And, information will be updated over several iterations and its not for commercial use cases.

Every diseases will show certain traits. And, here we will be picking few major diseases which is causing severe impact in human kind and the possibility of leveraging AI in those areas. 


**Few Basics:**

**DNA:** DNA is like a instruction about our human body, which is made up of four bases mainly (A, T, C and G). It consists of billions of pairs. There are approx 19500 gene categories, attached the list where we can normally find it in wiki.

Gene Count: We as a humans have approximately 19,000-20,000 genes (attached the list), though exact count may vary slightly depending on the source. Genes can indeed be looked up in databases like the one on Wikipedia, which provides an overview of various gene categories and functions.


**RNA and Transcription:**
Converting DNA to RNA: The process of converting DNA into RNA is called transcription. During transcription, an enzyme called RNA polymerase reads the DNA sequence and creates a complementary RNA strand.
Key Difference (T to U): In RNA, thymine (T) is replaced by uracil (U), so whenever thereâ€™s an "A" on the DNA template, it pairs with "U" in the RNA. This switch from "T" to "U" is a unique feature of RNA.

**Proteins:**

1. DNA, gene list and its example
2. RNA (concepts and conversion of DNA to RNA with example python scripts)
3. Protien Structure and the list of available open source platforms for further study
4. Similarity Identifications (with python examples)
5. Famous Similarity scores: PAM, BLOSUM Matrices etc. and its open source tools for calculations.
6. Few Classifications/Applications
