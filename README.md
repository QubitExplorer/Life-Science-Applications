# Life-Science-Applications

Here, we will be exploring few healthcare life science applications, and to understand about basics of human gene, DNA, RAN and protiens, classifications, major diseases traits and role of AI in healthcare applications.

**Please note:** Healthcare requires a high level of expertise, and the information provided here is intended solely for educational purposes only. And, information will be updated over several iterations and its not for commercial use cases.

Every diseases will show certain traits. And, here we will be picking few major diseases which is causing severe impact in human kind and the possibility of leveraging AI in those areas. 

**Few Topics:**
1. DNA, gene list and its example
2. RNA (concepts and conversion of DNA to RNA with example python scripts)
3. Protien Structure and the list of available open source platforms for further study
4. Similarity Identifications (with python examples)
5. Famous Similarity scores: PAM, BLOSUM Matrices etc. and its open source tools for calculations.
6. Few Classifications/Applications
